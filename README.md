in my PHP project, the README.md file serves as a place to provide essential information about the project. It typically includes details like what the project does, how to set it up, any dependencies it might have, how to use it, and any other relevant information for users or contributors. It's often the first point of reference for anyone looking to understand, use, or contribute to your project

The goal of the README.md file is to effectively communicate essential information about the project to anyone who comes across it. This includes users who want to understand how to use the application, developers who want to contribute to the codebase, or anyone interested in understanding the purpose and functionality of the project. It essentially serves as a user manual and an introduction to your project.
